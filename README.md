# Ultimate Dogma

> Wir mussen wissen. Wir werden wissen. (We must know. We will know.) *David Hilvert*

After several trial in building a personal knowledge base, finally I create this site, [ultimate dogma](ultimatedogma.com).

In ultimate dogma, you can find:

- My knowledge base. There're plenty of notes where you can find ideas and tutorials.
- My task board. This should be a *Trello*-like 'kanban' system, but it's currently under development
- My paper repository. Researchers always read a lot of papers, and I want to organize them in a git way :-)
